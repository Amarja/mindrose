                            Most organizations change in programs fail because people don’t see or understand the need for change. They say a good beginning is half the work done while we feel that "awareness" is half the work done. Without acceptance and awakening at all levels, even the best programs will fail to produce any results.

                            Once the leadership, coaches and team members are awakened to a new level of possibility, they need to be supported with the right skills, processes and operational tools to achieve that level of result. This skill may be a leadership, coaching or communication skill, teamwork, creativity and innovation related. A plan has to be created for each level of the organization for a successful transformation.

                            Conducting training is not enough. To make any change permanent, it is important that all organizational processes and behaviors are aligned to the new way of operating. The new way of being has to be wired into the new processes around people or else the old processes will pull us back.
